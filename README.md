## 1. Overview
The target of the project is updating the [existing Simetra web page](https://publictransport.simetragroup.ru/rating). It was especially important to create a new visualization of the rating, give fresh air for the existing design and make it all interactive for people who are not familiar with any programming language. At the date of the end of creation of the web page our team is sure that all work has been done and all targets have been achieved. The whole developing process has been done for two month: from beginning of March 2022 to beginning of May 2022. 

## 2. Instruction
The project has two sections: open and closed. The first one is used for representation of the visualization. The second one - for its interactive updating. All information on how to reach the closed section of the page is sent for the customer. It is impossible to control the closed section using this GitHub repository.
